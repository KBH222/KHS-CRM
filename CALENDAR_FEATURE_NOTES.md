# Calendar Feature Enhancement Notes

## Overview
Transform the current job-focused schedule into a full-featured calendar system that can handle all types of events, not just jobs.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Mixed Event Types
- Jobs/work appointments (existing)
- Personal appointments
- Meetings
- Reminders
- Birthdays
- Follow-ups
- Lunch breaks
- Time blocks

### 2. Event Categories with Colors
- Work (jobs) - existing colors
- Personal - different color scheme
- Meetings
- Calls
- Deadlines

### 3. Quick Event Creation
- Natural language input: "Dentist 2pm" or "Call supplier 10am"
- No need to fill full form for simple events

### 4. Recurring Events
- Weekly team meetings
- Monthly check-ins
- Daily standups
- Custom recurrence patterns

### 5. All-Day Events
- Holidays
- Birthdays
- Company events
- PTO/Vacation days

### 6. Time Blocking
- Block out focus time
- Lunch breaks
- Travel time between jobs
- Administrative time

### 7. Shared Calendars
- See other team members' availability
- Avoid scheduling conflicts
- Team overview

## Alarm/Reminder System

### Notification Options
- Browser push notifications
- Email reminders
- SMS (with Twilio integration)
- In-app notifications

### Timing Options
- 15 minutes before
- 30 minutes before
- 1 hour before
- 1 day before
- Custom time
- Multiple reminders per event

### Technical Requirements
- Browser notification permissions
- Service workers for push notifications
- Background sync for reliability
- Web Notifications API integration

## Implementation Considerations

### Potential Challenges
- Feature creep - increased complexity
- More code = more potential bugs
- Additional data models and relationships
- More UI states and edge cases
- Increased testing burden
- Performance considerations

### Recommended Approach

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Build calendar features as separate, optional modules
   - Keep job scheduling as the core feature
   - Other events are secondary/optional

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Start with basic event types
   - Add features gradually
   - Ensure graceful degradation

3. **Unified Data Model**
   ```javascript
   // Single events table/model
   {
     id: string,
     type: 'job' | 'meeting' | 'reminder' | 'personal' | 'block',
     title: string,
     startDate: Date,
     endDate: Date,
     allDay: boolean,
     
     // Common fields
     description?: string,
     location?: string,
     reminders?: Reminder[],
     recurring?: RecurrenceRule,
     color?: string,
     category?: string,
     
     // Job-specific fields (only when type === 'job')
     customerId?: string,
     workers?: string[],
     price?: number,
     status?: string
   }
   ```

4. **Code Reuse**
   - Current job display/edit logic works for all events
   - Same UI components handle all event types
   - Existing drag-and-drop works for all events

5. **Backwards Compatibility**
   - Jobs continue to work exactly as they do now
   - Calendar features are additive, not replacements
   - If calendar features break, job scheduling still functions

## Benefits
- Complete scheduling solution
- See entire day/week/month in one place
- Better time management
- Avoid double-booking
- More professional tool
- Competitive with Google Calendar

## MVP Features (Phase 1)
1. Add basic event types (meeting, reminder)
2. Use existing UI with type selector
3. Simple reminder system (browser notifications only)
4. Keep current job functionality unchanged

## Future Phases
- Phase 2: Recurring events, email reminders
- Phase 3: Team calendars, availability checking
- Phase 4: Mobile app with native notifications
- Phase 5: Calendar sync (Google, Outlook)

## Summary
This enhancement would transform the app from a job scheduler into a comprehensive time management tool while maintaining its core job tracking functionality. The key is implementing it modularly so the existing robust job features remain stable while new calendar capabilities are added progressively.
