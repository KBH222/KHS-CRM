# KHS CRM Security Update - Phase 1 Complete

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. API Credentials Removed ✅
- Removed exposed Google API credentials from frontend code
- API keys and Client IDs are no longer hardcoded in the application
- Google Drive sync service now returns false for `isConfigured()` to prevent initialization

### 2. Customer Data Sync Disabled ✅
- Customer data sync to Google Drive has been permanently disabled
- `syncCustomers()` method now only returns local data
- `fullSync()` method no longer uploads customer data to cloud
- Added security warning component to inform users

### 3. Local-Only Customer Storage ✅
- Customer data is now marked as RESTRICTED and never leaves the device
- Added data classification system:
  - PUBLIC: App settings (can sync)
  - INTERNAL: Job data (can sync within org)
  - CONFIDENTIAL: Worker info (requires encryption)
  - RESTRICTED: Customer PII (never syncs)

### 4. Audit Logging Implemented ✅
- All data access operations are now logged
- Audit log tracks: timestamp, action, data type, success/failure
- Sensitive data is redacted in logs
- Maximum 1000 log entries retained

### 5. Security Settings UI ✅
- Added new Security Settings page accessible from dashboard
- Users can control:
  - Audit logging on/off
  - Encryption settings
  - Sync permissions by data type
  - Local network only sync option
- Shows audit log statistics and allows clearing logs

- [ ] Create secure backend authentication service
- [ ] Add OAuth token encryption

### Phase 3 - Local Network Sync:
- [ ] Implement WebRTC for peer-to-peer sync

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never store API credentials in frontend code**
2. **Always classify data before storage/sync**
3. **Audit all data access operations**
4. **Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit**
5. **Default to most restrictive permissions**
6. **Provide clear security status to users**

## Breaking Changes

- Google Drive sync is currently non-functional
- Customer data will not sync between devices
- Users must reconfigure sync settings after security update
