# KHS CRM Security Update - Phase 2 Complete

## Phase 2 Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Data Encryption ✅
- Created `encryptionService.ts` using Web Crypto API
- AES-GCM encryption for CONFIDENTIAL data classification
- PBKDF2 key derivation from user password
- Secure storage of encryption salt
- Automatic encryption/decryption for sensitive data

### 2. Secure Authentication ✅
- Created `authService.ts` with local authentication
- Password hashing using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Session management with 8-hour expiry
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts (15 min)
- Secure password comparison (constant time)
- Integration with encryption service

### 3. Local Network Sync ✅
- Created `localNetworkSync.ts` for peer-to-peer sync
- WebSocket-based communication on local WiFi
- Automatic device discovery
- Respects data classification rules
- Customer data never leaves device
- Real-time sync status display

### 4. Progressive Security Disclosure ✅
- Created comprehensive onboarding flow
- 5-step security education process
- Clear explanation of data classifications
- Privacy commitment disclosure
- User consent checkpoints

## New Components Created

### Security Components:
- `EncryptionSetup.tsx` - Master password creation
- `EncryptionLogin.tsx` - Unlock encrypted data
- `AuthSetup.tsx` - Initial authentication setup
- `LoginForm.tsx` - User login interface
- `LocalNetworkStatus.tsx` - Local sync status/control
- `SecurityOnboarding.tsx` - Security education flow

### Services:
- `encryptionService.ts` - Data encryption/decryption
- `authService.ts` - Authentication management
- `localNetworkSync.ts` - P2P sync on local network
- `secureStorage.ts` - Async storage with encryption

## Security Architecture

### Data Flow:
1. **Onboarding** → User learns about security features
2. **Authentication** → Password protects app access
3. **Encryption** → Optional master password for sensitive data
4. **Local Storage** → All data stays on device
5. **Local Sync** → P2P sync on WiFi (no cloud)

### Data Classifications in Action:
- **RESTRICTED**: Customer PII - Never syncs, never leaves device
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Worker data - Encrypted at rest, local sync only
- **INTERNAL**: Job data - Can sync locally
- **PUBLIC**: Settings - Can sync freely

## User Experience Flow

### First Launch:
1. Security onboarding (5 steps)
2. Authentication setup (create password)
3. Optional encryption setup
4. Main app access

### Subsequent Launches:
1. Login with password
2. Unlock encryption (if enabled)
3. Auto-connect to local sync
4. Full app access

## Security Features Summary

### Phase 1 (Complete):
- ✅ Removed API credentials from frontend
- ✅ Disabled customer data cloud sync
- ✅ Local-only customer storage
- ✅ Data classification system
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Security settings UI

### Phase 2 (Complete):
- ✅ AES-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- ✅ PBKDF2 password hashing
- ✅ Session-based authentication
- ✅ WebSocket local network sync
- ✅ Progressive security onboarding
- ✅ Device discovery on local network

## Breaking Changes from Phase 1

1. **Authentication Required**: Users must now create a password
2. **Onboarding Flow**: New users see security education
3. **Encryption Option**: Can enable data encryption
4. **Local Sync**: Replaces cloud sync entirely

## Migration Notes

For existing installations:
1. Users will see onboarding on next launch
2. Must create authentication password
3. Can optionally enable encryption
4. Google Drive sync permanently disabled
5. Local network sync available as replacement

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
2. **Zero Trust**: Authenticate every access
3. **Data Minimization**: Only sync what's needed
4. **Encryption at Rest**: For sensitive data
5. **Local First**: Data stays on user devices
6. **Progressive Disclosure**: Educate users gradually

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. Biometric authentication support
2. Backup/recovery for encrypted data
3. Certificate pinning for local sync
4. End-to-end encryption for sync
5. Security audit dashboard

### Maintenance:
1. Regular security audits
2. Update crypto algorithms as needed
3. Monitor for security advisories
4. User security training materials

## Support

Users experiencing issues with the new security features should:
1. Check Security Settings page
2. Review audit logs
3. Ensure devices on same network for sync
4. Contact support for password reset procedures
