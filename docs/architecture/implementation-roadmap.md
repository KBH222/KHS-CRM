|----------|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Frontend Framework** | React 18 | - Mature ecosystem<br>- Strong PWA support<br>- Team familiarity<br>- Excellent TypeScript support | Vue 3: Less ecosystem<br>Angular: Too heavy<br>Svelte: Less mature |
| **State Management** | Zustand | - Simple API<br>- TypeScript friendly<br>- Lightweight (8KB)<br>- No boilerplate | Redux: Too complex<br>MobX: Learning curve<br>Context API: Limited features |
| **Offline Storage** | IndexedDB | - Large storage capacity<br>- Structured data<br>- Transaction support<br>- Wide browser support | localStorage: 10MB limit<br>WebSQL: Deprecated<br>Cache API: Not structured |
| **Backend Runtime** | Node.js | - JavaScript everywhere<br>- Huge ecosystem<br>- Fast development<br>- Good performance | Deno: Less mature<br>Python: Different language<br>Go: Steeper learning curve |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | - ACID compliance<br>- JSON support<br>- Full-text search<br>- Proven reliability | MySQL: Less features<br>MongoDB: No transactions<br>DynamoDB: Vendor lock-in |
| **Deployment** | AWS ECS Fargate | - Serverless containers<br>- Auto-scaling<br>- No server management<br>- Cost effective | EC2: More management<br>Lambda: Cold starts<br>Kubernetes: Too complex |

### Key Technical Decisions

#### 1. Offline-First Architecture

**Decision**: Build offline-first from day one

**Rationale**:
- Construction sites often lack connectivity
- Better user experience (instant responses)
- Competitive advantage
- Reduces server load

**Implementation**:
- Service workers for request interception
- IndexedDB for structured data
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background sync queue

**Risks**:
- Complexity in sync logic
- Larger initial bundle size
- Browser compatibility issues

**Mitigation**:
- Extensive sync testing
- Progressive enhancement
- Fallback mechanisms

#### 2. Monorepo Structure

**Decision**: Single repository for all code

**Rationale**:
- Atomic commits across stack
- Shared TypeScript types
- Simplified dependency management
- Easier refactoring

**Implementation**:
- npm workspaces
- Shared packages
- Unified build process
- Single CI/CD pipeline

**Risks**:
- Large repository size
- Longer clone times
- Complex dependencies

**Mitigation**:
- Shallow clones for CI
- Careful dependency management
- Clear workspace boundaries

#### 3. JWT with Refresh Tokens

**Decision**: Stateless auth with short-lived access tokens

**Rationale**:
- Scalability (no server sessions)
- Security (short expiry)
- Mobile friendly
- Standard approach

**Implementation**:
- 15-minute access tokens
- 30-day refresh tokens
- Secure httpOnly cookies
- Automatic refresh

**Risks**:
- Token theft
- Refresh complexity
- Storage security

**Mitigation**:
- HTTPS everywhere
- Secure storage
- Token rotation
- Revocation capability

#### 4. Progressive Web App

**Decision**: PWA instead of native apps

**Rationale**:
- Single codebase
- No app store friction
- Instant updates
- Lower development cost

**Implementation**:
- Service workers
- Web manifest
- App shell architecture
- Push notifications

**Risks**:
- iOS limitations
- Less native features
- User perception

**Mitigation**:
- Feature detection
- Graceful degradation
- Clear install instructions
- Native-like UX
