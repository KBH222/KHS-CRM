# ✅ Backend Connection Issues - RESOLVED!

## Summary

The backend connection issues have been successfully resolved by installing PostgreSQL locally on Windows.

## What Was Done

1. **Installed PostgreSQL 17** locally on Windows
2. **Created database and user**:
   - Database: `khs_crm`
   - User: `khs_user` 
   - Password: `khs_dev_password`
3. **Updated backend configuration** to use local PostgreSQL
4. **Migrated database schema** successfully
5. **Created test users** with proper password hashing
6. **Verified authentication** is working correctly
7. **Switched frontend** to use real API instead of mock data

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components:
- **PostgreSQL**: Running locally on port 5432
- **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5174
- **Authentication**: Fully functional with JWT tokens
- **Database**: Populated with test users

### 📝 Test Credentials:
- **Owner Account**: owner@khs.com / password123
- **Worker Account**: worker@khs.com / password123

## How to Start the Application

1. **Start Backend** (Terminal 1):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend** (Terminal 2):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser**: http://localhost:5174

4. **Login** with test credentials above

## Database Management

You can manage your database using:
- **pgAdmin**: Installed with PostgreSQL
- **Command Line**: `psql -U postgres -d khs_crm`
- **Prisma Studio**: `cd backend && npx prisma studio`

## Next Development Steps

The connection issues are resolved! You can now:
1. ✅ Login with real authentication
2. 🔄 Implement real data fetching for dashboard
3. 🔄 Add customer CRUD operations
4. 🔄 Add job management features
5. 🔄 Implement material tracking

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Ensure PostgreSQL service is running in Windows Services
2. Check that no other application is using port 5432
3. Verify Redis is still running in Docker for session management
4. Check backend logs for any error messages

## Success! 🎉

Your KHS CRM is now fully operational with:
- Real database connection
- Working authentication
- All API endpoints ready
- Frontend connected to backend

You can now continue development with full database functionality!
